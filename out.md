### Project Overview: mg-miner

#### Purpose and Functionality

**mg-miner** is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze, collect, detect, redact, and summarize files within a given project directory. It supports the identification of various components, redaction of sensitive information, and generation of detailed summaries, making it ideal for codebase analysis, compliance checks, and project documentation. 

#### Key Features

1. **File Collection**:
   - **Function**: Collects files based on specified configurations, including the exclusion of certain directories and file types.
   - **Implementation**: Uses a `FileCollector` class to traverse the directory structure and copy relevant files to the output directory.

2. **Component Detection**:
   - **Function**: Identifies different components (backend, frontend, testing frameworks, etc.) within the project based on file types and patterns.
   - **Implementation**: The `ComponentDetector` class analyzes files and categorizes them according to predefined patterns in the configuration.

3. **Sensitive Information Redaction**:
   - **Function**: Redacts sensitive information from files to comply with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
   - **Implementation**: The `Redactor` class uses patterns defined in `compliance_patterns.json` to find and replace sensitive data with placeholders.

4. **Summary Creation**:
   - **Function**: Generates an HTML summary of the project's components and saves it along with a JSON representation of the summary.
   - **Implementation**: The `SummaryCreator` class compiles data from detected components and produces a structured summary, which can be saved both as an HTML file and in a SQLite database.

5. **CLI Interface**:
   - **Function**: Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the tool.
   - **Implementation**: Built using the `click` library, the CLI supports commands such as `collect`, `detect`, `redact`, `summary`, and `query` to execute different parts of the tool's functionality.

6. **Cloud Upload Support**:
   - **Function**: Uploads analysis results to cloud storage services (AWS, GCP, Azure).
   - **Implementation**: Integration with cloud storage APIs to securely store results and summaries for further analysis or compliance purposes.

7. **Database Storage**:
   - **Function**: Stores the results and summaries in a SQLite database.
   - **Implementation**: The utility functions include methods to save data to and query data from a SQLite database, ensuring results are stored efficiently and can be retrieved easily.

8. **Logging and Configuration**:
   - **Function**: Provides detailed logging and flexible configuration options.
   - **Implementation**: Utilizes environment variables and YAML configuration files to manage settings and log output, ensuring the tool can be easily customized and monitored.

#### Configuration and Customization

- **Configuration Files**:
  - **config.yml**: Main configuration file for specifying directories, exclusion patterns, compliance standards, and cloud upload settings.
  - **setup_logging.json**: Defines the logging configuration, allowing for customization of log levels and formats.

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `.env` file: Used to store environment-specific settings, such as cloud service credentials and paths.

#### Example CLI Commands and Output

1. **Collect Files**:
   ```sh
   mg_miner collect --config configs/config.yml --verbose
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   INFO - Collecting files...
   INFO - Created directory: test_output
   INFO - Copied test_input/file1.py to test_output/file1.py
   INFO - File collection complete.
   ```

2. **Detect Components**:
   ```sh
   mg_miner detect --config configs/config.yml --verbose
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   INFO - Detecting components...
   INFO - Components detected and saved to test_output/components.json
   ```

3. **Redact Sensitive Information**:
   ```sh
   mg_miner redact --config configs/config.yml --verbose
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   INFO - Redacting sensitive information...
   INFO - Redacted sensitive information in test_output/file1.txt
   ```

4. **Create Summary**:
   ```sh
   mg_miner summary --config configs/config.yml --verbose
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   INFO - Creating summary...
   INFO - Summary created and saved to test_output/summary.html and test_output/summary.db
   ```

5. **Query Summary from Database**:
   ```sh
   mg_miner query --config configs/config.yml --verbose
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   [{'id': '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'category': 'backend', 'files': '["file1.py"]'}, ...]
   ```

#### Implementation Plan and Strategy

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
   - Configure the environment using `.env` and `config.yml` files.
   - Set up logging using `setup_logging.json`.

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Use virtual environments for dependency management.
   - Ensure consistent coding standards with tools like `flake8` and `black`.

3. **Unit and Integration Testing**:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for each core component and utility function.
   - Develop integration tests to validate the entire workflow, including file collection, component detection, redaction, and summary creation.

4. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
   - Integrate cloud storage for result upload and ensure secure handling of credentials.

5. **Documentation and Readme**:
   - Provide detailed documentation, including examples, configuration options, and CLI usage.
   - Include a grading rubric and project hygiene metrics for users to assess their projects.

6. **Release Management**:
   - Follow semantic versioning for releases.
   - Use tags and branches to manage different versions and feature sets.
   - Regularly update the changelog and documentation to reflect new features and improvements.

By following this detailed implementation plan and utilizing the comprehensive features of mg-miner, users can effectively analyze, secure, and document their projects, ensuring compliance and improving overall code quality.

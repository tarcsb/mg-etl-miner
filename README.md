# MG Miner

MG Miner is a comprehensive tool designed to mine and summarize project files, frameworks, testing and much more. This README provides an overview of the project, the content of each file, and information on how to contribute and support the project.

The goal is to use AI/ML to identify areas for project migration cost/risk reduction along with reducing cloud energy costs.

The miner is part of a 3-4 service cloud package (In dev) offerig may services from small to enterprise level organizations in all sectors of business while being in compliance.

The emphasis is oneasy of use and accuracty in identifying maturity, risk, completness, testing ans timely investment. Run paralle migrationl collecting failures and wins to make its elfs better in simulated enviornments.

Note: this product is still in beta/prototype.I continue to maketimely improvments on my free time!
